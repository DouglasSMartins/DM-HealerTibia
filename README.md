# DM Healer
*DM Healer* features macros, shortcuts and auto-healers for the PC game Tibia. Created with AutoHotkey, an automation scripting language for Windows.

These ahk scripts were developed for my personal use. I've used and improved them for over a year and never had issues with bans or BattleEye.

I am not playing Tibia anymore but, as I did put a lot of effort into understanding AHK and developing this, I'm sharing it for public use and maybe to colaborate with other AHK developers to improve it.
